\arguments{
\item{type}{type of power analysis, one of \code{'a-priori'}, \code{'post-hoc'}, \code{'compromise'}.}

\item{comparison}{comparison model, one of \code{'saturated'} or \code{'restricted'} (the default). This determines the df for power analyses. \code{'saturated'} provides power to reject the model when compared to the saturated model, so the df equal the one of the hypothesized model. \code{'restricted'} provides power to reject the hypothesized model when compared to an otherwise identical model that just omits the restrictions defined in \code{nullEffect}, so the df equal the number of restrictions.}

\item{nWaves}{number of waves, must be >= 2.}

\item{autoregEffects}{vector of the autoregressive effects of X and Y (constant across waves), or a list of vectors of autoregressive effects for X and Y from wave to wave, e.g. \code{list(c(.7, .6), c(.5, .5))} for a autoregressive effect of .7 for \code{X1 -> X2} and .6 for \code{X2 -> X3} and autoregressive effects of .5 for \code{Y1 -> Y2} and \code{Y2 -> Y3}. Must be a list of lists for multiple groups models. If the list structure is omitted, no group differences are assumed.}

\item{crossedEffects}{vector of crossed effects of X on Y \code{(X -> Y)} and vice versa (both constant across waves), or a list of vectors of crossed effects giving the crossed effect of X on Y (and vice versa) for each wave, e.g. \code{list(c(.2, .3), c(.1, .1))} for \verb{X1 - > Y2} = .2, \code{X2 -> Y3} = .3, \code{Y1 -> Y2} = .1, and \code{Y2 -> Y3} = .1. Must be a list of lists for multiple groups models. If the list structure is omitted, no group differences are assumed.}

\item{rXY}{vector of (residual-)correlations between X and Y for each wave. If \code{NULL}, all (residual-)correlations are zero. Can be a list for multiple groups models, otherwise no group differences are assumed.}

\item{waveEqual}{parameters that are assumed to be equal across waves in both the H0 and the H1 model. Valid are \code{'autoregX'} and \code{'autoregY'} for autoregressive effects, \code{'crossedX'} and \code{'crossedY'} for crossed effects, \code{'corXY'} for residual correlations, or \code{NULL} for none (so that all parameters are freely estimated, subject to the constraints defined in \code{nullEffect}).}

\item{nullEffect}{defines the hypothesis of interest. Valid are the same arguments as in \code{waveEqual} and additionally \code{'autoregX = 0'}, \code{'autoregY = 0'}, \code{'crossedX = 0'}, \code{'crossedY = 0'} to constrain the X or Y autoregressive effects or the crossed effects to zero, \code{'autoregX = autoregY'} and \code{'crossedX = crossedY'} to constrain them to be equal for X and Y, and \code{'autoregXA = autoregXB'}, \code{'autoregYA = autoregYB'}, \code{'crossedXA = crossedXB'}, \code{'crossedYA = crossedYB'} to constrain them to be equal across groups.}

\item{nullWhich}{used in conjunction with \code{nullEffect} to identify which parameter to constrain when there are > 2 waves and parameters are not constant across waves. For example, \code{nullEffect = 'autoregX = 0'} with \code{nullWhich = 2} would constrain the second autoregressive effect for X to zero.}

\item{nullWhichGroups}{for hypothesis involving cross-groups comparisons, vector indicating the groups for which equality constrains should be applied, e.g. \code{c(1, 3)} to constrain the relevant parameters of the first and the third group. If \code{NULL}, all groups are constrained to equality.}

\item{standardized}{whether all parameters should be treated as standardized (\code{TRUE}, the default), implying that unstandardized and standardized regression relations have the same value. If \code{FALSE}, all regression relations are unstandardized.}

\item{standardizedResidualCovariances}{whether the residual covariances provided in \code{rXY} should be interpreted as correlations. When \code{TRUE} (the default) the unstandardized residual covariances differ from the those provided in \code{rXY}. When \code{FALSE}, the values provided in \code{rXY} are the unstandardized residual covariances, and the standardized residual correlations differ.}

\item{metricInvariance}{whether metric invariance over waves is assumed (\code{TRUE}, the default) or not (\code{FALSE}). This affects the df when the comparison model is the saturated model and generally affects power (also for comparisons to the restricted model).}

\item{autocorResiduals}{whether the residuals of the indicators of latent variables are autocorrelated over waves (\code{TRUE}, the default) or not (\code{FALSE}). This affects the df when the comparison model is the saturated model and generally affects power (also for comparisons to the restricted model).}

\item{...}{mandatory further parameters related to the specific type of power analysis requested, see \code{\link[=semPower.aPriori]{semPower.aPriori()}}, \code{\link[=semPower.postHoc]{semPower.postHoc()}}, and \code{\link[=semPower.compromise]{semPower.compromise()}}, and parameters specifying the factor model.

\description{
Convenience function for performing power analysis on effects in a cross-lagged panel model (CLPM).
This requires the lavaan package.
}
\details{
This function performs a power analysis to reject various hypotheses arising
in crossed-lagged panel models (CLPM). In a standard CLPM implemented here,
two variables X and Y are repeatedly assessed at two or more different time points (\code{nWaves}), yielding
autoregressive effects (stabilities; X1 -> X2 and Y1 -> Y2),
synchronous effects (X1 <-> Y1, X2 <-> Y2), and cross-lagged effects (X1 -> Y2 and Y1 -> X2).
CLPM including more than two waves are typically implemented assuming that the parameters are constant across waves (\code{waveEqual}), and usually omit lag-2 effects (e.g., X1 -> Y3).
CLPM based on latent factors usually assume at least metric invariance of the factors over waves (\code{metricInvariance}).

Relevant hypotheses in arising in a CLPM are:
\itemize{
\item \code{autoregX = 0} and \code{autoregY = 0}: Tests the hypothesis that the autoregressive effect of X and Y, respectively, is zero.
\item \code{crossedX = 0} and \code{crossedY = 0}: Tests the hypothesis that the crossed effect of X on Y (\code{crossedX}) and of Y on X (\code{crossedY}), respectively, is zero.
\item \code{autoregX = autoregY}: Tests the hypothesis that the autoregressive effect of X and Y are equal.
\item \code{crossedX = crossedY}: Tests the hypothesis that the crossed effect of X on Y (\code{crossedX}) and of Y on X (\code{crossedY}) are equal.
\item \code{autoregX} and \code{autoregY}: Tests the hypothesis that the autoregressive effect of X and Y, respectively, is equal across waves.
\item \code{crossedX} and \code{crossedY}: Tests the hypothesis that the crossed effect of X on Y (\code{crossedX}) and of Y on X (\code{crossedY}), respectively, is equal across waves.
\item \code{corXY}: Tests the hypothesis that the (residual-)correlations between X and Y are equal across waves.
\item \code{autoregXA = autoregXB} and \code{autoregYA = autoregYB}: Tests the hypothesis that the autoregressive effect of either X or Y are equal across groups.
\item \code{crossedXA = crossedXB} and \code{crossedYA = crossedYB}: Tests the hypothesis that the crossed effect of X on Y (\code{crossedX}) or of Y on X (\code{crossedY}), respectively, is equal across groups.
}

For hypotheses regarding the random-intercept CLPM, see \code{\link[=semPower.powerRICLPM]{semPower.powerRICLPM()}}. For hypothesis in autoregressive models, see \code{\link[=semPower.powerAutoreg]{semPower.powerAutoreg()}}.

Beyond the arguments explicitly contained in the function call, additional arguments
are required specifying the factor model and the requested type of power analysis.

Additional arguments related to the \strong{definition of the factor model}:
\itemize{
\item \code{Lambda}: The factor loading matrix (with the number of columns equaling the number of factors).
\item \code{loadings}: Can be used instead of \code{Lambda}: Defines the primary loadings for each factor in a list structure, e. g. \code{loadings = list(c(.5, .4, .6), c(.8, .6, .6, .4))} defines a two factor model with three indicators loading on the first factor by .5, , 4., and .6, and four indicators loading on the second factor by .8, .6, .6, and .4.
\item \code{nIndicator}: Can be used instead of \code{Lambda}: Used in conjunction with \code{loadM}. Defines the number of indicators by factor, e. g., \code{nIndicator = c(3, 4)} defines a two factor model with three and four indicators for the first and second factor, respectively. \code{nIndicator} can also be a single number to define the same number of indicators for each factor.
\item \code{loadM}: Can be used instead of \code{Lambda}: Used in conjunction with \code{nIndicator}. Defines the loading either for all indicators (if a single number is provided) or separately for each factor (if a vector is provided), e. g. \code{loadM = c(.5, .6)} defines the loadings of the first factor to equal .5 and those of the second factor do equal .6.
}

So either \code{Lambda}, or \code{loadings}, or \code{nIndicator} and \code{loadM} need to be defined.
If the model contains observed variables only, use \code{Lambda = diag(x)} where \code{x} is the number of variables.

Note that the order of the factors is (X1, Y1, X2, Y2, ..., X_nWaves, Y_nWaves), i. e., the first factor is treated as the first measurement of X, the second as the first measurement of Y, the third as the second measurement of X, etc..

Additional arguments related to the requested type of \strong{power analysis}:
\itemize{
\item \code{alpha}: The alpha error probability. Required for \code{type = 'a-priori'} and \code{type = 'post-hoc'}.
\item Either \code{beta} or \code{power}: The beta error probability and the statistical power (1 - beta), respectively. Only for \code{type = 'a-priori'}.
\item \code{N}: The sample size. Always required for \code{type = 'post-hoc'} and \code{type = 'compromise'}. For \code{type = 'a-priori'} and multiple group analysis, \code{N} is a list of group weights.
\item \code{abratio}: The ratio of alpha to beta. Only for \code{type = 'compromise'}.
}

If a \strong{simulated power analysis} (\code{simulatedPower = TRUE}) is requested, optional arguments can be provided as a list to \code{simOptions}:
\itemize{
\item \code{nReplications}: The targeted number of simulation runs. Defaults to 250, but larger numbers greatly improve accuracy at the expense of increased computation time.
\item \code{minConvergenceRate}:  The minimum convergence rate required, defaults to .5. The maximum actual simulation runs are increased by a factor of 1/minConvergenceRate.
\item \code{type}: specifies whether the data should be generated from a population assuming multivariate normality (\code{'normal'}; the default), or based on an approach generating non-normal data (\code{'IG'}, \code{'mnonr'}, \code{'RC'}, or \code{'VM'}).
The approaches generating non-normal data require additional arguments detailed below.
\item \code{missingVars}: vector specifying the variables containing missing data (defaults to NULL).
\item \code{missingVarProp}: can be used instead of \code{missingVars}: The proportion of variables containing missing data (defaults to zero).
\item \code{missingProp}: The proportion of missingness for variables containing missing data (defaults to zero), either a single value or a vector giving the probabilities for each variable.
\item \code{missingMechanism}: The missing data mechanism, one of \code{MCAR} (the default), \code{MAR}, or \code{NMAR}.
\item \code{nCores}: The number of cores to use for parallel processing. Defaults to 1 (= no parallel processing). This requires the \code{doSNOW} package.
}

\code{type = 'IG'} implements the independent generator approach (IG, Foldnes & Olsson, 2016) approach
specifying third and fourth moments of the marginals, and thus requires that skewness (\code{skewness}) and excess kurtosis (\code{kurtosis}) for each variable are provided as vectors. This requires the \code{covsim} package.

\code{type = 'mnonr'} implements the approach suggested by Qu, Liu, & Zhang (2020) and requires provision of  Mardia's multivariate skewness (\code{skewness})  and kurtosis  (\code{kurtosis}), where
skewness must be non-negative and kurtosis must be at least 1.641 skewness + p (p + 0.774), where p is the number of variables. This requires the \code{mnonr} package.

\code{type = 'RK'} implements the approach suggested by Ruscio & Kaczetow (2008) and requires provision of the population distributions
of each variable (\code{distributions}). \code{distributions} must be a list (if all variables shall be based on the same population distribution) or a list of lists.
Each component must specify the population distribution (e.g. \code{rchisq}) and additional arguments (\code{list(df = 2)}).

\code{type = 'VM'} implements the third-order polynomial method (Vale & Maurelli, 1983)
specifying third and fourth moments of the marginals, and thus requires that skewness (\code{skewness}) and excess kurtosis (\code{kurtosis}) for each variable are provided as vectors.
