semPower
=====
  
semPower is an R-package that provides several functions to perform a-priori, compromise, and post-hoc power analyses for structural equation models (SEM). 

(Very) basic functionality is also provided as a shiny app, which you can use online at [https://sempower.shinyapps.io/sempower](https://sempower.shinyapps.io/sempower/).

## Installation

`semPower` can be installed via [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=semPower). The CRAN version often lags behind the development version, which can be installed as follows:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("moshagen/semPower")
```

## Manual

Find a detailed manual at [https://moshagen.github.io/semPower/](https://moshagen.github.io/semPower/). 

We also recommend this in-depth tutorial on power analyses in SEM using a previous version of semPower. Although some information are outdated, this provides a detailed description on generic model based power analysis:

## Quick Examples for model-free power analyses

Determine the required sample size to detect misspecifications of a model (involving df = 100 degrees of freedom) corresponding to RMSEA = .05 with a power of 80% on an alpha error of .05:
  
```
ap <- semPower.aPriori(effect = .05, effect.measure = 'RMSEA', 
                       alpha = .05, power = .80, df = 100)
summary(ap)
```

Determine the achieved power with a sample size of N = 1000 to detect misspecifications of a model (involving df = 100 degrees of freedom) corresponding to RMSEA = .05 on an alpha error of .05:
  
```
ph <- semPower.postHoc(effect = .05, effect.measure = 'RMSEA', 
                       alpha = .05, N = 1000, df = 100)
summary(ph)
```

Determine the critical chi-square such that the associated alpha and beta errors are equal, assuming sample size of N = 1000, a model involving df = 100 degrees of freedom, and misspecifications corresponding to RMSEA = .05:
  
```
cp <- semPower.compromise(effect = .05, effect.measure = 'RMSEA', 
                          abratio = 1, N = 1000, df = 100)
summary(cp)
```

Plot power as function of the sample size to detect misspecifications corresponding to RMSEA = .05 (assuming df = 100) on alpha = .05:
  
```
semPower.powerPlot.byN(effect = .05, effect.measure = 'RMSEA', 
                       alpha = .05, df = 100, power.min = .05, power.max = .99)
```

Plot power as function of the magnitude of effect (measured through the RMSEA assuming df = 100) at N = 500 on alpha = .05:
  
```
semPower.powerPlot.byEffect(effect.measure = 'RMSEA', alpha = .05, N = 500, 
                            df = 100, effect.min = .001, effect.max = .10)
```

Obtain the df of a model provided as lavaan model string (this requires the lavaan package):
  
```
lavModel <- '
f1 =~ x1 + x2 + x3
f2 =~ x4 + x5 + x6
'
semPower.getDf(lavModel)
```

Determine the required sample size to discriminate a model exhibiting an RMSEA of .04 on 44 df from a model with RMSEA = .05 on 41 df with a power of 80% on an alpha error of .05:
  
```
ap <- semPower.aPriori(effect = c(.04, .05), effect.measure = 'RMSEA', 
                       alpha = .05, power = .80, df = c(44, 41))
summary(ap)
```

Detect that the intercept-slope covariance differs across groups in a two-group 3-wave LGCM:

```
powerLGCM <- semPower.powerLGCM(
  # define type of power analysis
  'a-priori', alpha = .05, power = .80, N = list(1, 1),
  # define hypothesis
  nWaves = 3,
  means = c(.5, .2),
  variances = c(1, .5),
  covariances = list(
    c(.25), # group 1
    c(.1)), # group 2
  nullEffect = 'isCovA = isCovB',
  groupEqual = c('ivar', 'svar'),
  # define measurement model
  loadings = list(
    c(.6, .7, .5),
    c(.6, .7, .5),
    c(.6, .7, .5)
  ),
  autocorResiduals = TRUE
)
summary(powerLGCM)
```

## Simulated power analysis

Perform a simulated power-analysis with 500 replications and non-normal data with a population multivariate skewness of 10 and multivariate kurtosis of 200 to determine the sample size to detect that a correlation between the first and the second factor of at least .3 differs from zero:
```
Phi <- matrix(c(
  c(1, .3, .4, .5),
  c(.3, 1, .2, .6),
  c(.4, .2, 1, .1),
  c(.5, .6, .1, 1)
), ncol = 4, byrow = TRUE)

set.seed(1234)
powerCFA <- semPower.powerCFA(
  # define type of power analysis
  type = 'a-priori', alpha = .05, power = .80,
  # define hypothesis
  Phi = Phi,
  nullEffect = 'cor = 0',
  nullWhich = c(1, 2),
  # define measurement model
  loadings = list(
    c(.7, .6, .5),
    c(.5, .8, .6),
    c(.7, .6, .5),
    c(.5, .8, .6)),
  # request simulated power analysis
  simulatedPower = TRUE,
  simOptions = list(
    nReplications = 500,
    type = 'mnonr',
    skewness = 10,
    kurtosis = 200
  ))
  
summary(powerCFA)
