semPower 2.2.0 (development)
===========

* single group/occasion identification is now the default in models assuming metric or scalar invariance in powerMI and powerLI. The previous behavior can be obtained by setting singleGroupIdent = FALSE / singleOccasionIdent = FALSE.
* allow referent scaling in powerMI and powerLI
* allow multifactor models at each measurement in powerLI
* more sensible structure of returned simulated data in the multigroup case 
* add option to specify a specific strategy to resolve futures when using parallel processing to estimate simulated power
* bugfix: proper evaluation of parameter bias in simulated power when models involve a single factor or single regression relations. 
* bugfix: respect requested autocorrelated residuals without invariance constraints in powerARMA, powerAutoreg


semPower 2.1.3 (August 2025)
===========

* update to R 4.5.0
* add option to estimate direct effects with population values of zero in powerMediation
* bugfix: fix genSigma with supplied means when Lambda includes secondary loadings


semPower 2.1.2 (February 2025)
===========

* bugfix: make simulated power work properly for multigroup models with > 2 groups 


semPower 2.1.1 (September 2024)
===========

* update to R 4.4.0
* bugfix: don't rely on dummy latents in powerMediation with only observed variables. This led to underestimated effects and thus underestimated power.    
* bugfix: fix edge cases with variable ordering in user-provided Sigmas
* bugfix: make definition of factor model via Lambda in powerBifactor work


semPower 2.1.0 (September 2023)
===========

* support WLS discrepancy functions in analytical power analyses


semPower 2.0.1 (May 2023)
===========

* update to R 4.3.0
* bugfix: make futures work


semPower 2.0.0 (May 2023)
===========

* first CRAN release of semPower 2
